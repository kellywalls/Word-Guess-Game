# Word Guess Game

## GT Coding Bootcamp Homework #3


#### Description:
This is a word guess game with the theme of the greatest Rock Bands of all time. 

The computer randomly selects a band's name and display "_" for each letter in the name. The user gets 10 tries to guess the hidden work. 

As the user types a letter the "_" character that corresponds to the letter(s) position in the word is replaced with the letter. If the letter is not in the work then the remaining number of tries is reduced by 1.

If the user guesses all of the letters before they run out of tries then they win that game.
